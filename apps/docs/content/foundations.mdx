# Foundations

This design system is organized around shared tokens, reusable primitives, and platform-specific component packages.

## Principles

- Consistency across product surfaces
- Composition over one-off customization
- Accessibility and sensible defaults
- Token-first theming
- Clear web/native separation where platform APIs differ

## Architecture

- `packages/tokens`: design contract (colors, spacing, typography, etc.)
- `packages/hooks`: reusable behavior primitives
- `packages/utils`: providers and cross-platform helper components
- `packages/web`: web component system
- `packages/native`: React Native component system

## Documentation strategy

- `apps/docs`: setup guidance, package references, architecture docs
- `apps/storybook`: interactive examples and visual validation
