# @tesserix/admin-conformance

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- cf92438: Fix the `admin-conformance` binary, which npm stripped at publish time. The `bin` path was `./dist/cli.js`; npm rejects the `./` prefix and silently removed the entry, so `npx @tesserix/admin-conformance` — the invocation the contract documents — resolved to nothing. The built CLI also carried no shebang, so it could not have executed even with a valid `bin` entry.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 38cf5a3: Add `@tesserix/admin-conformance`, the enforcement half of the Product Admin Integration Contract (§5). A product declares which endpoints it implements in `admin-conformance.json` and runs the CLI against its own admin API in CI; the suite skips the rest and fails on any declared endpoint that deviates. Includes a TypeScript port of the platform HMAC signing scheme, checked against the reference implementation's published golden vectors.
